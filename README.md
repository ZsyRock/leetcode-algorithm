As an old Chinese saying goes: 

    1. A good memory is not as good as a bad writing; 
    
    2. Review the past and learn the new.

I'm going to record some of the solutions I made while learning leetcode. These are the algorithms I used when doing leetcode questions.

This reminds me of when I was studying plane geometry in High school. My math teacher often explained to us different ways to solve problems and encouraged us to try various heuristic solutions. This is of great help to our thinking, and it has benefited me a lot to this day. 

So when I am learning algorithms, I also hope to record more methods.
